        <h3>가사</h3>
        desolation isolation
that means where I stand
combination of information
that means where I've been

discomfort of depression 
I know well it's ill
but anxiety in reality
it would never disappear

I know I need to be sure about me
and I know I need to stop repeating wandering
It's hard, it will always be
I'm fully aware of it

I wanna have falling 
endlessly dreams again
long for the rough texture 
of Chinese old bricks
wish I could run on the 
rugged hill of cornfield again
I wanna swim in the 
nostalgia of childhood again
